# criptoclasica
Python tools for classical cryptanalysis with a mathematical focus: frequency analysis, IC, Hill cipher algebra, Vigenère attacks, transposition reconstruction, and statistical methods for ciphertext analysis.
## Overview
This repository provides a modular collection of scripts for analysing and breaking classical ciphers. Each tool is designed for teaching, research, and reproducible experiments in classical cryptanalysis, following mathematically rigorous methods.

## Features
- **Monoalphabetic ciphers**: Caesar, affine, mixed alphabets, decimation.
- **Frequency analysis**: monographic, digraphic, index of coincidence.
- **Polyalphabetic ciphers**: Vigenère, Kasiski test, subtext extraction, IC-based key length estimation.
- **Polygraphic ciphers**: Hill cipher (2×2), matrix algebra, modular inverses, involutive matrices.
- **Transposition systems**: columnar transposition, double transposition, column compatibility checks.
- **Statistical tools**: distribution comparison, circular correlation, coincidence counting.
